	abstract = {Estimates of functional connectivity using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) are acutely sensitive to artifacts and large scale nuisance variation. As a result much effort is dedicated to preprocessing rs-fMRI data and using diagnostic measure to identify bad scans. One such diagnostic measure is DVARS, the spatial standard deviation of the data after temporal differencing. A limitation of DVARS however is the lack of concrete interpretation of the absolute values of DVARS, and finding a threshold to distinguish bad scans from good. In this work we describe a variance decomposition of the entire 4D dataset that shows DVARS to be just one of three sources of variation we refer to as D-var, S-var and E-var. D-var and S-var partition the average variance between adjacent time points, while E-var accounts for edge effects, and each can be used to make spatial and temporal summary diagnostic measures. Extending the partitioning to global (and non-global) signal leads to a rs-fMRI DSE ANOVA table, which decomposes the total and global variance into fast (D-var), slow (S-var) and edge (E-var) components. We find expected values for each variance component under nominal models, showing how D-var (and thus DVARS) scales with overall variance and is diminished by temporal autocorrelation. Finally we propose a sampling distribution for squared DVARS (a multiple of D-var) and robust methods to estimate this null model, allowing computations of DVARS p-values. We propose that these diagnostic time series, images, p-values and ANOVA table will provide a succinct summary of the quality of a rs-fMRI dataset that will support comparisons of datasets over preprocessing steps and between subjects.},

Consequently, it is easy to use in simulation studies and has been applied in multiple areas, including risk management, stock return analysis and missing data imputation studies. A rapidly convergent quantile based least squares (QLS) estimation method to fit the g-and-h distributional family parameters is proposed and then extended to a robust version. The robust version is then used as a more general outlier detection approach. Several properties of the QLS method are derived and comparisons made with competing methods through simulation. Real data examples of microarray and stock index data are used as illustrations.},

Abstract = {In a classic two-sample problem, one might use Wilcoxon's statistic to test for a difference between treatment and control subjects. The analogous microarray experiment yields thousands of Wilcoxon statistics, one for each gene on the array, and confronts the statistician with a difficult simultaneous inference situation. We will discuss two inferential approaches to this problem: an empirical Bayes method that requires very little a priori Bayesian modeling, and the frequentist method of "false discovery rates" proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg in 1995. It turns out that the two methods are closely related and can be used together to produce sensible simultaneous inferences.; Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {When analyzing functional MRI data, several thresholding procedures are available to account for the huge number of volume units or features that are tested simultaneously. The main focus of these methods is to prevent an inflation of false positives. However, this comes with a serious decrease in power and leads to a problematic imbalance between type I and type II errors. In this paper, we show how estimating the number of activated peaks or clusters enables one to estimate post-hoc how powerful the selection procedure performs. This procedure can be used in real studies as a diagnostics tool, and raises awareness on how much activation is potentially missed. The method is evaluated and illustrated using simulations and a real data example. Our real data example illustrates the lack of power in current fMRI research.},
