The aim of this project is to obtain an x-ray image of a 3D printed sample and compare it with a simulation of that scan using software called \texttt{aRTist}. \texttt{aRTist} can simulate x-ray scans of the 3D printed sample given the specifications of the scan, such as the x-ray source, the x-ray detector and the blueprint of the 3D printed sample. Users of \texttt{aRTist} can align the simulated x-ray image to the real x-ray image using numerical methods, however this is outside the scope of this thesis.

Disagreement between the scan and \texttt{aRTist} can be found by simply subtracting one image from the other, any values too big in magnitude can be considered as a defect. However in the previous chapters, it was found that x-ray photons behave randomly and large differences in the comparison can be due to chance. Thus the comparisons should be done under the face of uncertainty.

A pixel by pixel inference was proposed to do defect detection. A statistic $z_{i,j}$ for the $(i,j)$ positioned pixel can be calculated for all pixels. This statistic is
\begin{equation}
    z_{i,j} = 
    \dfrac{
        \text{scan}_{i,j} - \text{aRTist}_{i,j}
    }
    {
        \sqrt{\widehat{\variance}\left[\text{scan}_{i,j}\right]}
    }
\end{equation}
where $\widehat{\variance}\left[\text{scan}_{i,j}\right]$ is the estimated grey value variance of pixel $(i,j)$ in the scan. Under mild assumptions, it was shown in the previous chapters that the grey values in the scan are Normal. Thus by treating the simulated image from \texttt{aRTist} as known, then
\begin{equation}
z_{i,j}\sim \normal(0,1) \ .
\end{equation}
This means the randomness of the $z_{i,j}$ statistics can be quantified.

The estimation of the grey value variance, that is $\widehat{\variance}\left[\text{scan}_{i,j}\right]$ will be explained here. The variance model can be calibrated, or trained, by holding out a number replicated x-ray scans of a 3D printed sample. These replicated x-ray scans provide variance-mean data which then can be used to train the variance model, such as a Gamma distributed GLM. The method on doing so was described in the previous chapter and it was found a linear relationship between the variance and the mean was a good model. The variance was then predicted using the grey value in the \texttt{aRTist} simulation.

This method for inference can be applied to the dataset \texttt{Sep16 120deg}. The 20 x-ray images were spilt into 2. 19 images were used to train the variance-mean model. One image, called the test image, was used to compare with \texttt{aRTist}, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:inference_initial_artist_scan_aRTist}.

    \label{fig:inference_initial_artist_scan_aRTist}
\end{figure}

For each pixel, a $z_{i,j}$ statistic was calculated. A $z_{i,j}$ statistic too large in magnitude can be considered to be evidence of a positive result. Another way to represent the $z_{i,j}$ statistic is the $p$-value which is given as
\begin{equation}
    p_{i,j} = 2(1-\Phi(\|z_{i,j}\|))
\end{equation}
which can takes values $0\leqslant p_{i,j} \leqslant 1$. A $p$-value too small is considered to be evidence of a positive result. The result $z$ statistics and $p$-values are shown in Figure \ref{fig:inference_initial_artist_logp_z}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
    \centerline{

    \caption{The resulting z statistics and $p$ values comparing an x-ray scan with the \texttt{aRTist} simulation.}
    \label{fig:inference_initial_artist_logp_z}
\end{figure}

The resulting $z$ statistics and $p$-values are concerning. This is because the $p$-values are not very smooth on the surfaces of the sample. It should be expected that small $p$-values are in areas of the defects. Significant pixels were chosen for $\|z\|>\input{../tables/initial_artist_z_critical.txt}$, this value was chosen by using the \cite{benjamini1995controlling} algorithm at the $z_\alpha = 2$ significance level. The significant pixels are shown in Figure \ref{fig:inference_initial_artist_sig_pixels}.

This proposed method for defect detection failed because too many false positives were detected. These false positives appear to have some structure, for example clustering in the corners or on surfaces. In addition, false negatives were detected because not all of the defects were detected.

Model misspecification appears to be the main source of error. The $z$ statistics can be inspected using a histogram or a QQ plot, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:inference_initial_artist_z_histo}. It can be seen that the $z$ statistics do not look Normal which seems to suggest that the assumption of $z_{i,j}\sim \normal(0,1)$ is incorrect. However this assumption can relaxed and can be done using the empirical null \citep{efron2004large}.

This chapter will cover hypothesis testing, for a single test and then for multiple tests. The empirical null will then be reviewed which then can be extended to an image filter, called the empirical null filter. This filter will adjust each $z$ statistic according to its neighbours, ironing out false positive results. Simulations and actual results will be shown at the end of the chapter.

\section{Hypothesis Testing}

Hypothesis testing dates back to \cite{pearson1900on}, \cite{neyman1933on} and \cite{fisher1970statistical}. It is so fundamental in science that it is now taught in schools.

The focus on this section is on the single hypothesis test. Here the random variable $Z\sim\normal(\mu,1)$ will be studied here as this is of interest in this project. It also appears in other tests such as the difference in sample means.

In the context of this project, an example of hypothesis testing will be given here. Here, it was assumed that $Z\sim\normal(0,1)$. A null hypothesis can be written down to describe this
\begin{equation}
    H_0:\mu=0 \ .
\end{equation}
It specifies the assumptions made on the random variable $Z$. Any data behaving as assumed is treated as a negative result.

A positive result is obtained when unlikely data is obtained and this happens if $Z$ deviates too much from 0. This can be described as testing $H_0$ against an alternative hypothesis $H_1$ where
\begin{equation}
    H_1:\mu\neq0 \ .
\end{equation}
How much $Z$ deviates from 0 to be considered a positive is up to the user but typically $\|Z\|>z_\alpha$ where $z_\alpha =2$ is considered significant.

A way to quantify the threshold for a positive result is to use something called the size of the test, otherwise known as the significance level, denoted as $\alpha$. This is the probability of a false positive result, which can be denoted as
\begin{equation}
    \prob(\|Z\|>z_\alpha|H_0) = \alpha \ .
\end{equation}
Using the fact the Normal distribution is symmetric then
\begin{equation}
    2(1 - \Phi(z_\alpha)) = \alpha \ .
    \label{eq:inference_single_alpha}
\end{equation}
The choice of $z_\alpha=2$ will set the size of the test to be $\alpha\approx 4.55\%$. This sort of choice of threshold and size is sensible.

The $p$-value is a way to represent an observation of the data $Z=z$. Similar to the size, the $p$-value is
\begin{equation}
    p=2(1-\Phi(\|z\|)) \ .
\end{equation}
As a result, the $p$-value can be compared directly to the size of the test. That is there is a positive result if $p<\alpha$, otherwise it is a negative result.

The power of the test is defined as the probability of a true positive result. For unknown $\mu$, it is useful to investigate the power for a range of $\mu$.

\section{Multiple Hypothesis Testing}

In this section, the single hypothesis test will be extended and the multiple hypothesis testing \citep{shaffer1995multiple, dudoit2003multiple} shall be reviewed.

Suppose $n$ test statistics were obtained $Z_1,Z_2,\dotdotdot,Z_n$ where $Z_i\sim\normal(\mu,1)$ for $i=1,2,\dotdotdot,n$ and i.i.d. One can test each of these statistics for the following hypotheses $H_0:\mu=0$ and $H_1:\mu\neq 0$. Using the method from the single hypothesis test at the $z_\alpha=2$ level, any statistic where $\|Z_i\|>2$ for $i=1,2,\dotdotdot,n$ would be considered a positive result.

Bringing in methods from single hypothesis testing to the multiple version has drawbacks. Assuming that the null hypothesis is true for all $Z_i$ for $i=1,2,\dotdotdot,n$, then by definition $\alpha\approx 4.55\%$ of the data will be tested positive, and falsely positive. Still under the same assumption, the probability of at least one false positive result, known as the family-wise error rate (FWER) \citep{shaffer1995multiple}, is
\begin{align}
    \text{FWER}&=1-\prob(\text{no false positives}) \nonumber\\
    \text{FWER}&=1-\prob(\text{no positive results}|H_0) \nonumber\\
    \text{FWER}&=1-\left[(1-\alpha)^n\right] \label{eq:inference_fwer}\ .
\end{align}
To put into context, for $\alpha\approx 4.55\%$ and $n=20$ then remarkably $\text{FWER}\approx60.6\%$. This method for multiple hypothesis testing will have too many false positive results.

While the uncorrected method for multiple hypothesis testing has it flaws, it does control the per comparison error rate (PCER) \citep{benjamini1995controlling}. PCER is the proportion of false positives out of all tests. There are corrections for multiple hypothesis testing which controls different things. Conventionally they are expressed in terms of the number of errors made in testing, these are defined in Table \ref{table:inference_randomvariables}. Using the notation, formally PCER is defined as
\begin{equation}
    \text{PCER}=
    \dfrac{
        1
    }
    {
        n
    }
    \expectation[V]
    \ .
\end{equation}
It can be seen that if the uncorrected test controls the false positive rate such that $\expectation[V]/n_0 = \alpha$, then it controls the PCER such that
\begin{equation}
    \text{PCER}\leqslant\alpha \ .
\end{equation}

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
        &Negative&Positive&Total\\\hline
        True null & $U$ & $V$ & $n_0$\\
        Non-true null & $T$ & $S$ & $n-n_0$\\\hline
        &$n-R$&$R$&$n$
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Random variable definitions for the different types of error made in multiple hypothesis testing}
    \label{table:inference_randomvariables}
\end{table}

The Bonferroni correction \citep{shaffer1995multiple, bland1995multiple, perneger1998what} controls the FWER. This is done by adjusting the size of the test to be $\alpha/n$. By using the adjusted size, Equation \eqref{eq:inference_fwer} becomes
\begin{equation}
    \text{FWER}=1-\left[(1-\alpha/n)^n\right]\ .
\end{equation}
Using the approximation $(1-\alpha/n)^n\approx = 1-\alpha$ then
\begin{equation}
    \text{FWER}\approx \alpha \ .
\end{equation}
This shows that the Bonferroni correction controls the family-wise error rate such that
\begin{equation}
    \text{FWER} \leqslant \alpha \ .
\end{equation}
However in practice the Bonferroni correction is not very powerful \citep{perneger1998what}, meaning it does give too many false negative results. This is because the correction traded too many false positives for false negatives.

The \cite{benjamini1995controlling} (BH) procedure controls the false discovery rate (FDR) \citep{benjamini2010discovering} rather than the false positive or family-wise rate. The FDR is the proportion of false positives out of all positive results, that is
\begin{equation}
    \text{FDR} = \expectation\left[
        \dfrac{V}{R}
    \right]
    \ .
\end{equation}
It is defined that $V/R=0$ when $R=0$.

In practice the BH procedure adjusts the size of the test between the Bonferroni correction and the uncorrected test. The BH procedure also adapts to the data, meaning the procedure chooses different sizes for different data.

The procedure is as follows. Suppose $n$ test statistics were obtained $Z_1,Z_2,\dotdotdot,Z_n$. They will need to be converted to $p$-values and ordered such that $p_{(1)}\leqslant p_{(2)}\leqslant \dotdotdot \leqslant p_{(n)}$. The adjusted size $\alpha_{\text{BH}}$ is
\begin{equation}
    \alpha_{\text{BH}} = \frac{\alpha k}{n}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
    k\text{ is the largest }i\text{ for which }p_{(i)}\leqslant\frac{i}{n}\alpha
    \ .
\end{equation}
This essentially declare $p_{(1)},p_{(2)},\dotdotdot,p_{(k)}$ as positive results. For the case where $p_{(1)}>\alpha/n$, then $k=1$ shall be chosen so that the Bonferroni correction is used instead. The BH procedure comes from the fact that assuming the null hypothesis is true for all $Z_i$ and all tests are independent, then the $p$-values are uniformly distributed \citep{simes1986improved}. However it can be shown that the BH procedure works for many scenarios of dependencies \citep{benjamini2001control}. 

It can be shown that the BH procedure controls the FDR such that
\begin{equation}
    \text{FDR}\leqslant\pi_0\alpha\leqslant\alpha
\end{equation}
where $\pi_0=n_0/n$ \citep{benjamini1995controlling}, which is usually unknown in practice.

In summary, the uncorrected, Bonferroni and BH correction controls for different error rates according to the threshold $\alpha$, summarised in Table \ref{table:inference_corrections}.

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c}
        Correction&Controls for\\\hline
        No correction&$\text{PCER}\leqslant\alpha$\\
        Bonferroni&$\text{FWER}\leqslant\alpha$\\
        BH&$\text{FDR}\leqslant\alpha$
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Different types of corrections for multiple hypothesis testing are listed here, along with what they control for.}
    \label{table:inference_corrections}
\end{table}

\subsection{Examples}

A few numerical examples will be shown here to explore the properties of the 3 different types of methods to do multiple hypothesis testing. Two scenarios will be shown here. In the first case, 1\,000 $\normal(0,1)$ independent test statistics were simulated, all test statistics are all null. In the second case, 800 null $\normal(0,1)$ and 200 alternative $\normal(2,1)$ independent test statistics were simulated. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{../figures/inference/multi_test_nullhisto.eps}
	\caption{A histogram of simulated of 1\,000 null test statistics. Also provided are the critical boundaries at the $z_\alpha=2$ level, one uncorrected for multiple testing, another corrected using the Bonferroni correction.}
	\label{fig:inference_multi_test_nullhisto}
\end{figure}

A histogram of the test statistics in the all null case is shown in Figure \ref{fig:inference_multi_test_nullhisto}. The critical boundaries are also shown. In the uncorrected case, the critical region is $\|Z\|>2$. Using the Bonferroni correction, the critical region becomes $\|Z\|>4.08...$. By inspection of the histogram, the uncorrected method tested a number of test statistics to be positive and falsely so. The Bonferroni correction performs well because it tested all the test statistics as negative correctly.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{../figures/inference/multi_test_nullpvalues.eps}
	\caption{Ordered $p$-values of simulated 1\,000 null test statistics. Any values below the critical line are declared positive using the BH procedure.}
	\label{fig:inference_multi_test_nullpvalues}
\end{figure} 

The ordered $p$-values are shown in Figure \ref{fig:inference_multi_test_nullpvalues}. The $p$-values form a straight line as a result of being uniformly distributed. The critical line is $0.0455...\times\text{order}/1\,000$. This corresponds to the BH procedure and $p$-values below where the 2 curves intersect are considered positive results. In the all null case, the $p$-values are all larger than the critical line, thus no test statistic were tested positive using the BH procedure. As a result, the Bonferroni and BH procedure tested all test statistics to be negative correctly.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{../figures/inference/multi_test_althisto.eps}
	\caption{A histogram of simulated of 800 null $\normal(0,1)$ and 200 non-null $\normal(2,1)$ test statistics. Also provided are the critical boundaries at the $z_\alpha=2$ level using no correction, Bonferroni correction and the BH procedure.}
	\label{fig:inference_multi_test_althisto}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{../figures/inference/multi_test_altpvalues.eps}
    \caption{Ordered $p$-values of simulated 800 null $\normal(0,1)$ and 200 non-null $\normal(2,1)$ test statistics. Any values below the critical line are declared positive using the BH procedure.}
	\label{fig:inference_multi_test_altpvalues}
\end{figure}

In the second scenario, 800 $\normal(0,1)$ and 200 $\normal(2,1)$ test statistics were simulated. The histogram of the simulated test statistics, along with the critical regions, is shown in Figure \ref{fig:inference_multi_test_althisto}. The uncorrected and Bonferroni corrected critical regions are still the same as the first scenario. However this time the critical region using the BH procedure is different, it is $\|Z\|\geqslant\input{../tables/multi_test_alt_z_critical.txt}$.

The ordered $p$-values are shown in Figure \ref{fig:inference_multi_test_altpvalues}. There are $p$-values below the critical line according to the BH procedure, testing $\input{../tables/multi_test_alt_n_positive_bh.txt}$ test statistics as positive. The uncorrected test tested $\input{../tables/multi_test_alt_n_positive_uncorrected.txt}$ test statistics as positive.

This example shows a number of things. The BH procedure adapts to the data to control for the FDR. The uncorrected method did produce more positive results but at a cost of more false positives. It may seem unimpressive that the BH procedure only tested $\input{../tables/multi_test_alt_n_positive_bh.txt}$ positive results, but this is to control the FDR or the number of false positives out of all positive results.

Unfortunately not all 200 non-null test statistics were tested as positive, statisticians would describe it as not powerful. This is however unavoidable as a number of null and non-null test statistics will be similar in value. The aim of hypothesis testing is not to classify positive and negative results correctly, but rather highlight a number of test statistics which are worth investigating.

The error rates can be estimated as a result of knowing whenever each test statistic is truly null or non-null. Suppose the simulation was repeated $N$ times and $r_1,r_2,\dotdotdot,r_N$ number of test statistics were observed to be tested positive. From these positive results, suppose in addition that $v_1,v_2,\dotdotdot,v_N$ false positives were observed. In other words, they are realisations of the random variables defined in Table \ref{table:inference_randomvariables}. The error rates can be estimated
\begin{equation}
	\widehat{\text{PCER}} = \frac{1}{Nn}\sum_{i=1}^N v_i
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\widehat{\text{FWER}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbb{I}(v_i\neq 0)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\widehat{\text{FDR}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\dfrac{v_i}{r_i}\times\mathbb{I}(r_i\neq0)
	\ .
\end{equation}
The estimates of PCER and FDR is esentially the sample mean, so the standard error can be used to quantify the error. For the FWER, the variance of the Beta distribution is used to quantify the error
\begin{equation}
	\text{standard error of }\widehat{\text{FWER}} = 
	\sqrt{\dfrac{ab}{(a+b)^2(a+b+1)}}
\end{equation}
where $a = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbb{I}(v_i\neq 0)$ and $b = N - a$.

    \input{../tables/inference_error_rate1.txt}
    \caption{Various error rates when using different types of corrections for multiple hypothesis testing at the $z_\alpha=2$ level. 1\,000 test statistics were simulated, all standard Normal. Error bars represent the standard errors after 1\,000 repeats of the experiment.}

\end{table}

     \label{table:inference_error_rate1}
\end{table}

Error rates estimations for the two scenarios are shown in Tables \ref{table:inference_error_rate1} and \ref{table:inference_error_rate1} for $N=1\,000$. These estimations show that the 3 different types of multiple hypothesis controls for different rates. The uncorrected, Bonferroni and BH controls the PCER, FWER and FDR to be equal or below $\alpha\approx 0.455$ respectively, equality is met when all the test statistics are all truly null.

\section{Empirical Null}

By treating each pixel as a hypothesis test, methods for multiple hypothesis can be deployed. At the start of the chapter, a scan from the \texttt{Sep16 120deg} dataset was compared to the \texttt{aRTist} simulation, obtaining a $z$ image.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
    \centerline{
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/inference/empirical_null_sub_z_image.eps}
        \caption{$z$ image with section highlighted}
    \end{subfigure}
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/inference/empirical_null_sub_z_histo.eps}
        \caption{Histogram of section}
    \end{subfigure}
    }
    \caption{The resulting $z$ image. A histogram of a section of the $z$ image is shown.}
    \label{fig:inference_empirical_null_sub_z}
\end{figure}

A $200\times200$ section of the $z$ image was investigated by plotting the histogram as shown in Figure \ref{fig:inference_empirical_null_sub_z}. One could simply use the BH procedure at the $z_\alpha=2$ level to get the critical region of $\|Z\|>\input{../tables/empirical_null_sub_boundary.txt}...$. However a quick look at the histogram will show that almost half of the pixels will be tested as positive. It is questionable whether such number of positive results is sensible, in particular in an area where defects are not expected.

The histogram showed that the majority of the $z$ statistics are centred around 2 and has a bell shaped curve, a characteristic of the Normal distribution. If the data shows that the majority is centred elsewhere then expected, is it right to then to test the majority of the data as positive? This is an example of model misspecification because it was assumed that the $z$ statistics are distributed as $\normal(0,1)$ when in reality they are distributed as $\normal(\mu_0,\sigma_0^2)$.

The empirical null \citep{efron2004large} adjusts the assumptions made on the $z$ statistics according to the majority of the data and treating it as the norm, relaxing the assumptions needed. It requires the following assumptions: the majority of the data are truly null, non-null test statistics are rare and the null test statistics are Normal distributed.

The method will be described here. Suppose the following test statistics were obtained $z_1,z_2,\dotdotdot,z_n$. First the histogram needs to be smoothed. \cite{efron2004large} recommended using splines but a kernel density estimate \citep{parzen1962on, friedman2001elements} will be used here because it has simpler mathematical properties. The kernel density estimate is
\begin{equation}
	\widehat{p}_Z(z)=
	\frac{1}{nh}
	\sum_{i=1}^n\phi\left(
		\dfrac{z_i-z}{h}
	\right)
	\label{eq:inference_kernel_density_estimate}
\end{equation}
where $h$ is the bandwidth. The bandwidth was chosen such that
\begin{equation}
	h = 0.9n^{-1/5}\times\text{min}\left(s_z,\text{iqr}_z/1.34\right) + 0.16
	\label{eq:inference_ourruleofthumb}
\end{equation}
where $s_z$ and $\text{iqr}_z$ are the standard deviation and interquartile range. The parameters of the empirical null are estimated using the kernel density estimate. The resulting estimated density is shown in Figure \ref{fig:inference_empirical_null_sub_density_estimate}.

Next, the mode of the kernel density estimate, denoted as $\widehat{\mu}_0$, is to be found. This is then used as the mean of the empirical null \citep{efron2004large}. The calculation of $\widehat{\mu}_0$ can be numerically found using the Newton-Raphson method. Using the mode, the standard deviation of the empirical null is estimated using \citep{efron2004large}
\begin{equation}
	\widehat{\sigma}_0 = \left[
		\left.
			-\dfrac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}\ln\widehat{p}(z)
		\right|_{z=\widehat{\mu}_0}
	\right]^{-1/2}
	\ .
\end{equation}
In this particular example, it was found that $\widehat{\mu}_0=\input{../tables/empirical_null_sub_null_mu.txt}...$ and $\widehat{\sigma}_0=\input{../tables/empirical_null_sub_null_sigma.txt}...$. It was found that both of these estimators have negligible bootstrap \citep{efron1992bootstrap} variance or error.


The empirical null is used to correct the test statistics $z_1,z_2,\dotdotdot,z_n$ to $\zeta_1,\zeta_2,\dotdotdot,\zeta_n$ by standardising the test statistics
\begin{equation}
	\zeta_i = \dfrac{
		z_i - \widehat{\mu}_0
	}
	{
		\widehat{\sigma}_0
	}
	\ .
	\label{eq:inference_zeta}
\end{equation}
The corrected test statistics $\zeta_1,\zeta_2,\dotdotdot,\zeta_n$ are then used in any multiple hypothesis testing procedures. Using the BH procedure, the critical region was found to be $\|\zeta\|\geqslant\input{../tables/empirical_null_sub_null_critical_zeta.txt}...$ or in terms of the original units $Z \leqslant \input{../tables/empirical_null_sub_null_critical1.txt}...$ and $\input{../tables/empirical_null_sub_null_critical2.txt}...\leqslant Z$.

\end{figure}

These new critical regions are shown in Figure \ref{fig:inference_empirical_null_sub_z_critical_regions}. No positive results were found and the $p$-values are sensible as they look uniformly distributed. This demonstrated that the empirical null adjusts the parameters of the null distribution to fit the data in order to make sensible inference.

In this section, a more mathematical approach to the empirical null will be taken to examine why and when this method works. Next computational concepts will be discussed such as on how the mode of the kernel density estimator is found and what makes a good bandwidth in the kernel density estimator. 


\subsection{More on the Empirical Null}

\cite{efron2004large} was motivated to tackle problems observed in large scale multiple hypothesis testing, for example in microarrays \citep{hedenfalk2001gene, efron2002empirical, efron2003robbins}. These problems are similar to the one observed at the start of this chapter. The empirical null is now used widely, including in neuroimaging \citep{schwartzman2008false,schwartzman2009empirical}.

For formality, the null and alternative hypotheses shall be described here. Assume that the $z$ statistics under the null hypothesis are such that
\begin{equation}
	Z_i|H_0\sim\normal(\mu,\widehat{\sigma}_0^2)
\end{equation}
for $i=1,2,\dotdotdot,n$ and i.i.d. The hypotheses are then
\begin{equation}
	H_0:\mu = \widehat{\mu}_0
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
	H_1:\mu\neq\widehat{\mu}_0
	\ .
\end{equation}
Essentially null $z$ statistics are assumed to be Normal distributed, with parameters using the empirical null. Statistics which deviates too much from $\widehat{\mu}_0$ are considered to be positive.

The distribution of the $z$ statistics can be described using a mixture model. Let the random variable $Z$ have the probability density function
\begin{equation}
	p_Z(z) =
	\pi_0 p_{Z|H_0}(z) + \pi_1 p_{Z|H_1}(z)
\end{equation}
where $0\leqslant\pi_0\leqslant 1$ and  $\pi_1 = 1-\pi_0$. In addition, the null distribution is
\begin{equation}
	p_{Z|H_0}(z) = 
	\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\widehat{\sigma}_0}
	\exp\left[
		-\dfrac{1}{2}
		\left(
			\dfrac{z-\widehat{\mu}_0}{\widehat{\sigma}_0}
		\right)^2
	\right]
\end{equation}
as it was assumed to be Normal. The non-null distribution $p_{Z|H_1}(z)$ does not need to be specified.

The empirical null parameters can be obtained from the following. Assume that $\pi_0$ is large, say bigger than 0.9 \citep{efron2004large}, and at and around the mode the probability density function is dominated by the null distribution. This implies that
\begin{equation}
	p_{Z}(z) \approx \pi_0 p_{Z|H_0}(z)
\end{equation}
for values of $z$ around the mode. Finding the maximum for $p_{Z}(z)$ and $p_{Z|H_0}(z)$ should yield the same solution. This justifies the use of the mode for the empirical null mean \citep{efron2004large}
\begin{equation}
	\widehat{\mu}_0 = \argmax\widehat{p}_Z(z) \ .
\end{equation} 
The empirical null standard deviation can be obtained by noting that
\begin{equation}
	p_{Z}(z) = 
	\dfrac{\pi_0}{\sqrt{2\pi}\widehat{\sigma}_0}
	\exp\left[
		-\dfrac{1}{2}
		\left(
			\dfrac{z-\widehat{\mu}_0}{\widehat{\sigma}_0}
		\right)^2
	\right] \ .
\end{equation}
Taking the log of both sides
\begin{equation}
	\ln p_{Z}(z) = 
	\ln\left[
		\dfrac{\pi_0}{\sqrt{2\pi}\widehat{\sigma}_0}
	\right]
	-\dfrac{1}{2}
	\left(
		\dfrac{z-\widehat{\mu}_0}{\widehat{\sigma}_0}
	\right)^2
	\ .
\end{equation}
Taking derivatives of the log density
\begin{equation}
	\dfrac{\partial}{\partial z} \ln p_{Z}(z) =
	-\left(
		\dfrac{
			z-\widehat{\mu}_0
		}
		{
			\widehat{\sigma}_0^2
		}
	\right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\dfrac{\partial^2}{\partial^2 z} \ln p_{Z}(z) =
	-\dfrac{
		1
	}
	{
		\widehat{\sigma}_0^2
	}
\end{equation}
which motivates the estimator \citep{efron2004large}
\begin{equation}
	\widehat{\sigma}_0 = \left[
		\left.
			-\dfrac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}\ln\widehat{p}(z)
		\right|_{z=\widehat{\mu}_0}
	\right]^{-1/2}
	\ .
\end{equation}
The evaluation of $z=\widehat{\mu}_0$ is used as in that region, one would hope that null test statistics would dominate and non-null test statistics would not contribute much to the density estimate.

This method does not need estimations of $\pi_0$ which makes it quite useful. The estimations of $\pi_0$ is discussed in literature such as \cite{benjamini2000adaptive, pounds2003estimating, storey2003statistical, pounds2004improving, langaas2005estimating, durnez2014posthoc}. Because of the assumptions made on the empirical null, the easiest method is
\begin{equation}
	\widehat{\pi}_0 = \dfrac{\widehat{p}_Z(z)}{p_{Z|H_0}(\widehat{\mu}_0)}
	\ .
\end{equation}
\cite{efron2004large} also motives the use of the empirical null by investigating various types of false discovery rates \citep{storey2002direct, storey2003positive, efron2002empirical, efron2007size} which will not be discussed here.

\subsection{Mode Finding}

The mode can be found by solving for $\widehat{\mu}_0 = \argmax\widehat{p}_Z(z)$. This cannot be solved in closed form easily and should be done numerically. The  Newton-Raphson method can be used to solve $\hat{p}_Z'(z) = 0$ for $z$. Instead the log space will be used, solving
\begin{equation}
	\dfrac{
		\partial
	}
	{
		\partial z
	}
	\ln\widehat{p}_Z(z)
	= 0
\end{equation}
for $z$. This will at least find stationary points.

The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative algorithm and requires an initial value $z^{(0)}$. The iterative step is
\begin{equation}
	z^{(r+1)} =
	z^{(r)}
	-\dfrac{
		\left.
			\dfrac{
				\partial
			}
			{
				\partial z
			}
			\ln\widehat{p}_Z(z)
		\right|_{z = z^{(r)}}
	}
	{
		\left.
			\dfrac{
				\partial^2
			}
			{
				\partial z^2
			}
			\ln\widehat{p}_Z(z)
		\right|_{z = z^{(r)}}
	} 
\end{equation}
for $r=0,1,2,3,\dotdotdot$ until some convergence condition is met. The derivatives for the log density can be obtained via the following. Recall that the kernel density estimate is
\begin{equation}
	\widehat{p}_Z(z)=
	\frac{1}{nh}
	\sum_{i=1}^n\phi\left(
		\dfrac{z_i-z}{h}
	\right)
	\tag{\ref{eq:inference_kernel_density_estimate}}
\end{equation}
so that the log density is
\begin{equation}
	\ln\widehat{p}_Z(z)=
	\ln\left(
		\dfrac{1}{nh}
	\right)
	+
	\ln\left[
		\sum_{i=1}^n
		\phi\left(
			\dfrac{
				z_i - z
			}
			{
				h
			}
		\right)
	\right]
	\ .
\end{equation}
Taking the first derivative
\begin{equation}
	\dfrac{
		\partial
	}
	{
		\partial z
	}
	\ln\widehat{p}_Z(z)
	=
	\dfrac{
		1
	}
	{
		\sum_{i=1}^n
		\phi\left(
			\dfrac{
				z_i - z
			}
			{
				h
			}
		\right)
	}
	\times
	\sum_{i=1}^n
	\phi'\left(
		\dfrac{
			z_i - z
		}
		{
			h
		}
	\right)
	\left(
		-\dfrac{
			1
		}
		{
			h
		}
	\right)
	\ .
\end{equation}
Using the fact that $\phi(z)=(2\pi)^{-1/2}\exp(-z^2/2)$, then $\phi'(z)=-z\phi(z)$. This can be used to simplify the equation to be
\begin{equation}
	\dfrac{
		\partial
	}
	{
		\partial z
	}
	\ln\widehat{p}_Z(z)
	=
	\dfrac{
		\sum_{i=1}^n
		\phi\left(
			\dfrac{
				z_i - z
			}
			{
				h
			}
		\right)
		\left(
			\dfrac{
				z_i - z
			}
			{
				h
			}
		\right)
	}
	{
		h
		\sum_{i=1}^n
		\phi\left(
			\dfrac{
				z_i - z
			}
			{
				h
			}
		\right)
	}
	\ .
\end{equation}
Taking the derivative again
\begin{multline}
	\dfrac{
		\partial^2
	}
	{
		\partial z^2
	}
	\ln\widehat{p}_Z(z)
	=
	\left[
		h\sum_{i=1}^n
		\phi\left(
			\dfrac{
				z_i-z
			}
			{
				h
			}
		\right)
	\right]^{-2}
	\times
	\left\{
		h\left[
			\sum_{i=1}^n
			\phi\left(
				\dfrac{
					z_i-z
				}
				{
					h

			\right)
		\right]
	\right.
	\\
	\left.
		\times
		\sum_{i=1}^n\left[
			\phi'\left(
				\dfrac{
					z_i-z
				}
				{
					h

			\right)
			\left(
				-\dfrac{

				{

			\right)
			\left(

			\right)
			+\phi\left(

				{

			\right)
			\left(
				-\dfrac{

			\right)
		\right]
	\right.
	\\
	\left.
		-
		\left[
			\sum_{i=1}^n
			\phi\left(
				\dfrac{

				{

				}
			\right)
			\left(

			\right)
		\right]
		\left[
			h\sum_{i=1}^n
			\phi'\left(

			\right)
			\left(
				-\dfrac{
					1
				}
				{
					h
				}
			\right)
		\right]
	\right\}
	\ .
\end{multline}
Using the fact that $\phi'(z)=-z\phi(z)$, then it can be simplified to
\begin{multline}
	\dfrac{
		\partial^2
	}
	{
		\partial z^2
	}
	\ln\widehat{p}_Z(z)
	=
	\left[

			{

		\right)
	\right]^{-2}
	\times
	\left\{
		\left[
			\sum_{i=1}^n
			\phi\left(

				\dfrac{
					z_i-z
				}
				{
					h
				}
			\right)
		\right]^2
	\right\}
	\ .
\end{multline}

It was chosen that convergence is met when either 10 update steps were taken or when
\begin{equation}
	\left\|
		\dfrac{
			\partial
		}
		{
			\partial z
		}
	\ln\widehat{p}_Z(z)
	\right\|
	<10^{-5}
\end{equation}
at the current step. This was chosen arbitrary to speed up the algorithm without losing too much accuracy. At the end of the algorithm, for a successful convergence it was required, in addition, that
\begin{equation}
	\left.
		\dfrac{
			\partial^2
		}
		{
			\partial z^2
		}
		\ln\widehat{p}_Z(z)
	\right|_{z=\widehat{\mu}_0}
	< 0 \ .
\end{equation}
Following a successful convergence, the estimator $\widehat{\sigma}_0$ can be calculated straight away.

The algorithm does depend on the initial value so using different initial values is recommended. It was chosen here to use the quartiles of the data as the initial values and then select the best solution, the one with the largest $\ln\widehat{p}_Z\left(\widehat{\mu}_0\right)$, out of the different initial values. Should the algorithm still fail, a random data point is selected to be the initial value until a successful convergence is achieved. The Newton-Raphson method can fail if it converges to a stationary point other than a global maximum, for example a local maxima or a point of inflection. 

\subsection{Bandwidth Selection}

The choice of the bandwidth $h$ is important for the kernel density estimator. It controls how smooth the kernel density estimator is, with higher values of $h$ producing smoother curves \citep{friedman2001elements}. Cross validation methods do exist \citep{bowman1984alternative, sheather2004density} but they can be computationally expensive. Rules of thumb \citep{silverman1986density, sheather2004density} can be used instead and are typically of the form
\begin{equation}
	h = bn^{-1/5}\times\text{min}\left(s_z,\text{IQR}_z/1.34\right)
\end{equation}
where $b=0.9$ \citep{silverman1986density}. This rule of thumb was developed with consideration of bimodal Normal distributions \citep{silverman1986density}. Other options include $b=1.06$ and $b=1.144$ to produce smoother curves \citep{sheather2004density}.

In the context of the empirical null, the kernel density estimator is only used to obtain values of $\widehat{\mu}_0$ and $\widehat{\sigma}_0$. Thus a good bandwidth is one which has good properties of $\widehat{\mu}_0$ and $\widehat{\sigma}_0$ rather than the density estimate. However exact properties of these estimators based on the kernel density estimators can be rather complicated. Empirical properties shall be studied here.

    \label{fig:inference_ZNull2}
\end{figure}

An experiment was conducted to investigate the behaviour of the estimators, $\widehat{\mu}_0$ and $\widehat{\sigma}_0$, on a dataset of simulated all null $\normal(0,1)$. Various values of $h$ and $n$ were investigated. In reality non-null test statistics may appear in the dataset but they should not be too common and interfere with the density estimate too much. For a given $h$ and $n$, 50 values of $\widehat{\mu}_0$ and $\widehat{\sigma}_0$ were obtained by repeating the simulation. The median squared error for each of the estimators were plotted as shown in Figure \ref{fig:inference_ZNull1}.

$\widehat{\mu}_0$ has low median squared error for large bandwidths, in particular for low $n$. This is because smoother curves prevents any false bimodal features appearing, making it easier to find the mode.

A smooth valley can be seen for the median squared error for $\widehat{\sigma}_0$. It appears for a given $n$, there exist a bandwidth which minimise the median squared error. However the rules of thumb does not optimise for $\widehat{\sigma}_0$ and undershoots it. This can be particularly seen in Figure \ref{fig:inference_ZNull2} where the median values of $\widehat{\sigma}_0$ are plotted. In this simulation, the true value is $\sigma_0=1$ and all rules of thumb produced biased estimates, in particular underestimates it.

Overestimates and underestimates are both dangerous, but it depends on the importance of false positives and false negatives. This is because $\widehat{\sigma}_0$ is used to rescale the test statistics accordingly. Recall that the corrected test statistics are
\begin{equation}
	\zeta_i = \dfrac{
		z_i - \widehat{\mu}_0
	}
	{
		\widehat{\sigma}_0
	}
	\ .
	\tag{\ref{eq:inference_zeta}}
\end{equation}
Low values of $\widehat{\sigma}_0$ will produce high values in magnitude of $\zeta_i$, potentially testing more of these test statistics as positive. High values of $\widehat{\sigma}_0$ does the opposite. Large number of positive results can led to more false positive results and vice versa.

The optimal bandwidth for a given $n$ was found numerically. Such a relationship can be seen clearly seen in Figure \ref{fig:inference_ZNull_mse_plot} which plots the log mean squared error against the bandwidth for various $n$. A local quadratic regression \citep{friedman2001elements} was fitted and this was used to find the bandwidth which minimises the log squared error for a given $n$.

A relationship between the optimal bandwidth and $n$ was attempted to be found. It was assumed such a relationship has the linear from
\begin{equation}
	h_{\text{optimal}} = b n^{-1/5} + a
\end{equation}
where $b$ and $a$ are parameters to be fitted. Figure \ref{fig:inference_ZNull_mserule_of_thumb} show the fitting of an identity link Gamma GLM in order to estimate $b$ and $a$. The estimated parameters are shown in Table \ref{table:inference_ZNull_mse_glm_estimate}.

	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{../figures/inference/ZNull_mserule_of_thumb.eps}

\end{table}

The results show that the rules of thumb can be improved if a small bias is added to it. This is because an intercept was found when fitting a linear relationship between the optimal bandwidth and $n^{-1/5}$. Adding this bias should improve the performance of the estimator $\widehat{\sigma}_0$. The gradient is similar to the rules of thumb in the literature \citep{sheather2004density}.

Those familiar with local quadratic regressions would know that a kernel and a smoothness parameter need to be specified \citep{friedman2001elements}. In these plots a Gaussian kernel was used with smoothness parameter $\input{../tables/ZNull_bandwidth.txt}$. The smoothness parameter $\input{../tables/ZNull_bandwidth.txt}$ was chosen from a quick inspection of the curves. The units of the smoothness parameter is not too important here. But one should note that the smoothness parameter would affect the solution to the optimal bandwidth.

To take into the sensitivity to the smoothness parameter, the whole analysis was repeated using various smoothness parameters. The gradient and intercept for various smoothness parameters are shown in Figure \ref{fig:inference_ZNull_msesensitive}. It can seen that the intercept is fairly stable, including the gradient at smoothness parameter around $\input{../tables/ZNull_bandwidth.txt}$.

In conclusion, a small bias added to the rule of thumb will improve the performance of the estimator $\widehat{\sigma}_0$. \cite{silverman1986density} pointed out that a smaller bandwidth should be used when in particular the distribution is bimodal, this is why \cite{silverman1986density} suggest the use of $b=0.9$ rather than $b=1.06$. Following from this, it was chosen that the intercept shall be added to Silverman's rule of thumb for the use in the empirical null
\begin{equation}
	h = 0.9n^{-1/5}\times\text{min}\left(s_z,\text{IQR}_z/1.34\right) + 0.16
	\ .
	\tag{\ref{eq:inference_ourruleofthumb}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Further Discussion}

A further example will be given here. A $200\times200$ sub-sample, containing a defect, was taken as shown in Figure \ref{fig:inference_alt_empirical_z_image}. The histogram of the test statistics are shown in Figure \ref{fig:inference_alt_empirical_z_histogram}. It can be seen that the null distribution is not centred at zero, however the empirical null takes that into account. The estimation of the empirical null parameters are robust as it only depends on the density estimate at the mode only, it should not be affected by non-null test statistics.

The BH procedure can be conducted, corrected for the empirical null. The $p$-values are shown in \ref{fig:inference_alt_empirical_z_p_values}, a number of them are significant. The significant pixels are shown in red in Figure \ref{fig:inference_alt_empirical_z_image}. The majority of the significant pixels are cluster together and highlighting the defect. Not all of the defect was tested positive, but a good number of them are. This should be enough to raise suspicion in that particular area.

\end{figure}

Only a few pixels were falsely tested as positive, however they are typically isolated single pixels. Isolated positive pixels should be discarded as they are more than likely to be tested positive by random chance. The technician should of improved the resolution of the x-ray apparatus if one is looking for defects, a or two pixel in size, for the given resolution.

Clusters of significant pixels should raise suspicions. One could create a binary image, assigning a Boolean value whether that pixel is tested positive or not. A binary image filter, such as erode followed by a dilate, can be used to remove isolate significant pixels and emphasise the cluster of significant pixels.

The empirical null is a good tool for defect detection under model misspecification. One possible implementation is to spilt the $z$ image into a grid and conduct inference in each section separately. There are problems with this though. The first problem is that how the grid is overlaid can be arbitrary, for example the grid can be translated to produce different sections. Secondly one could ask how the results from each section are combined \citep{efron2008simultaneous}? The empirical null filter is another implementation for the empirical null which only requires a window size to be specified.


\section{Empirical Null Filter}

The empirical null filter is an extension to the empirical null. In this setting, the parameters of the empirical null varies spatially. Let $Z_{x,y}$ be the test statistic at position $(x,y)$, then
\begin{equation}
	Z_{x,y}\sim\normal\left(
		\mu_{0,x,y},\sigma_{0,x,y}^2
	\right)
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{0,x,y}$ and $\sigma_{0,x,y}$ are the empirical null mean and standard deviation at position $(x,y)$ respectively. The empirical null filter aims to estimate these parameters.

The method is the following. A window size needs to be specified, say $201\times201$. The window is placed over and centred at pixel $(x,y)$ capturing the pixels $z_{i,j}$ for $x-100\leqslant i \leqslant x+100$ and $y-100\leqslant j \leqslant y+100$. The estimators $\widehat{\mu}_{0,x,y}$ and $\widehat{\sigma}_{0,x,y}$ are the empirical null mean and standard deviation estimators, respectively, using the pixels captured in that window. This is then repeated for all $x$ and $y$. The $z$ statistics are then corrected using
\begin{equation}
	\zeta_{x,y} = 
	\dfrac{
		z_{x,y}-\widehat{\mu}_{0,x,y}
	}
	{
		\widehat{\sigma}_{0,x,y}
	}
\end{equation}
and only the corrected test statistics are used in the BH procedure.

There are ways to speed up the implementation of the empirical null filter by sacrificing accuracy. For example, instead of estimating the empirical null parameters for every pixel, a number of them can be estimated and then the remaining values can be interpolated. However it was found that interpolating $\widehat{\sigma}_{0,x,y}$ can yield highly varying results. To avoid this problem, it can be assumed that $\sigma_{0,x,y}=\sigma_0$ for all $x$ and $y$. Then the estimator $\widehat{\sigma}_0$ is the empirical null standard deviation estimator using all location corrected $z$ test statistics.

The empirical null filter was used on the example at the start of the chapter. It was used on a grid of $20\times 20$ points, the remaining values were interpolated. It was also assumed the empirical null standard deviation was constant, the methodology discussed in the previous paragraph.
